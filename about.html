      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space sailor," and refers to all who have been launched as
      crew members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. The term "astronaut" has been maintained as the title
      for those selected to join the NASA corps of astronauts who make "space sailing" their career profession.</p>

        <h3>We've trained hard</h3>
        <p>We train here on Earth in underwater tanks to simulate zero gravity. The training is geared to the special conditions and environments astronauts will be confronted with during launch, in space, and during landing. All phases of the flight must be considered during training to ensure safety to, and functionality of the astronauts, as well as to ensure a successful completion of the mission. The Apollo astronauts that walked on the Moon also received training for geology fieldwork on the Lunar surface.</p>

        <h3>We look Awesome</h3>
        <p>Can you think of any job more exciting than being an astronaut? Any astronaut will tell you, the hours are long, the work is hard and far from glamorous, but it's definitely exciting and rewarding. Who are the men and women who make up the astronaut corps? Is there a special quality that makes someone astronaut material?</p>
